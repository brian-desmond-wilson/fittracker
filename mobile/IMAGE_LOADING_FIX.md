# Image Loading Fix - Gemini API Configuration & React Native Compatibility

## The Problems

### Problem 1: Gemini API 404 Errors

The Gemini API was returning 404 errors because of incorrect authentication method:
- **Wrong**: Using API key as query parameter: `?key=${apiKey}`
- **Correct**: Using API key in header: `x-goog-api-key: ${apiKey}`

Also had incorrect configuration parameters:
- **Wrong**: `response_modalities: ['image']` (lowercase)
- **Correct**: `response_modalities: ['IMAGE']` (uppercase)
- **Missing**: `image_config` with aspect_ratio setting

### Problem 2: React Native SVG Compatibility

The placeholder images were being generated as SVG files, but React Native's built-in `<Image>` component **does not support SVG files** without additional libraries like `react-native-svg`.

### What Was Happening:
1. Edge Function failed to call Gemini API (404 error)
2. Fallback generated blue gradient SVG placeholder
3. Uploaded SVG to Supabase Storage successfully
4. Database updated with `image_url` pointing to the SVG
5. Mobile app tried to render the SVG using `<Image>` component
6. **Result**: Blank image area (SVG not supported)

## The Solution

### Fix 1: Correct Gemini API Configuration

Updated the Edge Function to use the correct authentication and configuration:

1. **Changed authentication method**
   - Removed query parameter: `fetch(url + '?key=' + apiKey)`
   - Added header: `'x-goog-api-key': geminiApiKey`

2. **Fixed configuration parameters**
   ```javascript
   generationConfig: {
     response_modalities: ['IMAGE'],  // Uppercase, not lowercase
     image_config: {
       aspect_ratio: '1:1',  // Square images for WOD cards
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Removed incorrect parameters**
   - Removed: `media_resolution: 'MEDIA_RESOLUTION_MEDIUM'` (not part of official API)

### Fix 2: Remove SVG Placeholder Fallback

Updated the Edge Function to **remove SVG placeholder fallback entirely**:

1. **Removed `createPlaceholderSvg()` function**
   - No longer generates SVG fallback images (React Native incompatible)

2. **Added `markImageGenerationFailed()` function**
   - Sets `image_generation_failed = true` on the WOD when generation fails
   - Allows for potential retry logic in the future

3. **Updated error handling**
   - When Gemini API key is missing: Returns early with error message
   - When Gemini API call fails: Marks WOD as failed, no image uploaded
   - When any error occurs: Marks WOD as failed in catch block

### New Behavior:

**With Correct API Configuration** (current state):
- Edge Function successfully calls Gemini API
- Real PNG image generated by AI (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Image uploaded to Supabase Storage
- `image_url` set to public URL
- `image_generated_at` timestamp recorded
- `image_generation_failed` set to `false`
- Mobile app displays the AI-generated image (80x80 thumbnail, 220px hero)

**If Gemini API Fails** (quota exceeded, etc.):
- Edge Function logs: "Gemini API error: [status code]"
- No image uploaded
- `image_generation_failed` set to `true`
- Mobile app shows no image (blank space)
- Can implement retry logic later

**If API Key Missing** (shouldn't happen now):
- Edge Function logs: "GEMINI_API_KEY not configured - skipping image generation"
- No image uploaded
- Mobile app shows no image (blank space)
- `image_generation_failed` remains `false` (never attempted)

## Why This Approach?

### Alternative Approaches Considered:

1. **Install react-native-svg library**
   - Adds dependency to mobile app
   - Overkill just for placeholder images
   - Still need to handle SVG rendering differently

2. **Generate PNG placeholder in Edge Function**
   - Deno doesn't have native canvas support
   - Would need external library (Deno Canvas)
   - Adds complexity for temporary placeholder

3. **Use static placeholder image asset**
   - Would need to upload to storage manually
   - Not dynamic per WOD
   - Defeats purpose of AI-generated images

### Chosen Approach: No Placeholder

**Rationale**:
- Simplest solution
- Once API key is set, all new WODs will get real AI images
- Old WODs without images just show blank space (acceptable UX)
- Failed generations can be retried later (future enhancement)
- No dependencies added to mobile app

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Set Gemini API Key

```bash
# Get API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 2: Create a New WOD

1. Open mobile app
2. Go to Training → WODs
3. Tap "+" to create new WOD
4. Fill in details and save

### Step 3: Verify Image Generation

**Check Edge Function Logs**:
- Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tffxvrjvkhpyxsagrjga/functions/generate-wod-image
- Click "Logs" tab
- Look for: "Image generation complete for WOD [id]"

**Check Storage**:
- Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tffxvrjvkhpyxsagrjga/storage/buckets/wod-images
- You should see a new PNG file: `[user_id]/[wod_id]_[timestamp].png`

**Check Mobile App**:
- WOD card should show 80x80 thumbnail on the right
- WOD detail screen should show 220px hero image at top
- Image should load within 5-10 seconds of WOD creation

## Files Modified

### `supabase/functions/generate-wod-image/index.ts`

**Removed**:
- `createPlaceholderSvg()` function (lines 29-45)

**Added**:
- `markImageGenerationFailed()` function
- Early return when API key not configured
- Proper error handling that marks failures

**Changed**:
- Error responses now mark WOD as failed instead of generating placeholder
- All error paths handled consistently

### `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`

**Updated**:
- Added "Quick Summary" section at top
- Clarified that no placeholder images are generated
- Explained React Native SVG limitation
- Made it clear that setting API key is the only remaining step

## Next Steps

1. **Set the Gemini API Key** (required for images to generate)
2. **Test with a new WOD** (verify PNG image is generated)
3. **Optional**: Implement retry logic for failed generations

## Future Enhancements

### Retry Failed Generations

You could add a background job that:
1. Finds all WODs where `image_generation_failed = true`
2. Retries image generation for each one
3. Updates the WOD if successful

Example query:
```sql
SELECT id, name, user_id
FROM wods
WHERE image_generation_failed = true
AND image_url IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Manual Retry Button

Add a "Retry Image Generation" button on WOD detail screen that:
1. Calls the Edge Function manually
2. Shows loading state
3. Updates image when complete

---

**Summary**: Removed SVG placeholder fallback because React Native doesn't support SVG in `<Image>` components. Once you set the Gemini API key, all new WODs will get real PNG images generated by AI.
